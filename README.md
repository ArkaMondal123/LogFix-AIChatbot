# LogFix-AIChatbot
its a chatbot and it has ai.


Built this for my school's annual "talent showcase" day (URJA), its meant for the school.
It can answer queries that have already been answered using spacy to compare questions to FAQs and gives an optimal answer.
The bot also stores all unanswered questions in a database along with an email address and teachers (or someone else) can answer those using a website.
